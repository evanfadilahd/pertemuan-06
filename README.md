    In this practicum, we implement the store method that we can use login and logout feature.

"2. Lines 25 and 30 have a parse() method, what happens if we don't use that method?"

    To give text output that we can divide into 2 parameters, login and logout... in default it is start from logout state.. then when we click button it is change to login state... We can give two different kind of text output this way!
